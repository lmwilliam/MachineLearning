Assuming there is an "unfair dice", the probability of each side being rolled is as follows:
1: 0.1, 2: 0.1, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.1, 5: 0.2, 6: 0.3
Please simulate to roll this dice 100 times and print the simulation result. As follows:
[5 6 3 2 3 6 6 6 6 3 5 …… 6 5 3 4 3 4]
Please calculate the probability of each point according to the simulation result and compare it with the original theoretical probability. As follows:
Theoretical probability: {1: 0.1, 2: 0.1, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.1, 5: 0.2, 6: 0.3}
Actual probability: {1: 0.16, 2: 0.09, 3: 0.26, 4: 0.05, 5: 0.22, 6: 0.22}
